Launch the shuttle to pass the level!
This contract will be a round up of a few contracts you've mastered earlier.
&nbsp;
Things that might help:
* When is msg.sender not equal to tx.id? See previous levels.
* How to check transaction parameters?
* What does block.number show?
* How do bitwise operaions work?

Have fun <3
